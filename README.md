# Infra Pairing Assessment

This project contains three services:

* `quotes` which serves a random quote from `quotes/resources/quotes.json`
* `newsfeed` which aggregates several RSS feeds together
* `front-end` which calls the two previous services and displays the results.

The services are provided as docker images. This README documents the steps to build the images and provision the infrastructure for the services.

# Development and operations tools setup

There are 2 options for getting the right tools on developer's laptop:
 * **quick** leverage Docker+Dojo. Requires only to install docker and dojo on your laptop.
 * **manual** requires to install all tools manually

 The rest of this file describes the quick way, please refer to [MANUAL_SETUP.md](MANUAL_SETUP.md) for the other option.

## Docker+Dojo setup

We can leverage docker to define required build and operation dependencies by referencing docker images.

[Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo) is a similar tool to [batect](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect/). It is just a wrapper around docker commands to bring up a well-defined development environment in containers.

This is the recommended approach as it enforces consistency between CI setup and the tools used by developers.

Assuming you already have a working docker, you can install dojo

**On OSX** with:

```sh
brew install kudulab/homebrew-dojo-osx/dojo
```

**On Linux** with:

```sh
DOJO_VERSION=0.8.0
wget -O dojo https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/releases/download/${DOJO_VERSION}/dojo_linux_amd64
sudo mv dojo /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dojo
```

This project is also using `make`, so ensure that you have that on your PATH too.

**On Windows** with:

Use the Linux steps above and use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you will need to be able to run Docker in this system to run the make commands.  Also please see section towards the bottom of this README for some extra tips to get it working.


## Dojo & Git

Along with a lot of other things, dojo leverages git configuration of the host system.

The git binary that's included in the dojo image is complied with `gnutls`.

If you have your git configuration's (`.gitconfig`) http ssl backend set to `openssl` it will cause terraform module initializaition issues:

```
│ error downloading
│ /usr/bin/git exited with 128: Cloning into
│ fatal: Unsupported SSL backend 'openssl'. Supported SSL backends:
│       gnutls
│ .
```

Best option is to unset this configuration for the interview:

```
[http]
  sslBackend
```

# Infrastructure setup

This is a multi-step guide to setup some base infrastructure, and then, on top of it, the test environment for the newsfeed application.

## Base infrastructure setup

With an assumption that we have a new, empty AWS account, we need to provision some base infrastructure just one time.
These steps will provision:
 * terraform backend in S3 bucket and locking with DynamoDB
 * a minimal VPC with 2 subnets
 * ECR repositories for docker images

### Setup aws credentials
The interviewer will send you an email with AWS credentials, which you should export in your shell.

```sh
export CODE_PREFIX=****
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=****
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=****
```

Now run:

```sh
source randomize.sh && randomize
make backend-support.infra
make base.infra
```

If you run ```make backend-support.infra``` and get an error indicating that these resources already exist then you don't need to run it again.  This simply creates the resources that manages Terraform state (S3 bucket and DynamoDB).  

## Build docker images

Artifacts from previous stage will be packaged into docker images, then pushed to ECR.

Each application has its own image. Individual image can be built with:

```sh
make <app-name>.docker
# for example:
make front-end.docker
```

But you can build all images at once with

```sh
make docker
```

## Push docker images

Before applications can be deployed on AWS, the docker images have to be pushed:

```sh
make push
```

## Provision services

Then, we can provision the backend and front-end services:

```sh
make news.infra
```

Terraform will print the output with URL of the front_end server, e.g.

```
Outputs:

frontend_url = http://34.244.219.156:8080
```

## Delete services

To delete the deployment provisioned by terraform, run following commands:

```sh
make news.deinfra
```

## Troubleshooting Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

You need to be running WSL 2 or above.

Before you run randomize you need to remove the two "" after the 'sed -i ' because you're not running the command on a Mac therefore it won't work properly without this change.

Some of the ```make``` commands may need to be tweaked to work for WSL, for example below I've added sudo and the minus -E flag to allow the sudo permissions to run containers as well as pass the existing environment variables to the container running the process to get it working.

```sh
sudo -E make news.infra
```

###  I get this error: '"docker-credential-desktop": executable file not found in $PATH'

One trick that can help is opening up the `~/.docker/config.json` and getting rid of the line that says:

```
"credsStore": ...
```

Then rerun the make command, add in sudo and -E if necessary.
